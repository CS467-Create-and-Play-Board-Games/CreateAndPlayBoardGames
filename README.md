Create and Play Board Games!

Download the .exe file and double click to run on a 64-bit Windows machine.

Create/edit a game board and then save it.  Saved games can be modified and saved as new games or you overwrite existing games.  Left click to place a tile.  Right click to remove a tile.  Cycle through the tiles using either +/- on your number keypad or the directional arrorws.  Use the camera to move you around via WASD keys.  Scroll in/out to zoom.  
Save validation - boards must have 1 and only one start tile, 1 and only 1 finish tile, and a path connecting the two.  Add as many action tiles as you desire.  Pick a good name to save the game by avoiding special characters.

Play a game with up to 8 players on any saved game board.  Animations and the UI show you whose turn it is.  Roll a 4 sided or 8 sided die.  Action tiles with sound keep the game interesting until the very end.  Camera follows the players and WASD and the scroll wheel can be used for the camera.  

Use the UI buttons to navigate around the game, go back, and exit the game.

Next development steps -- Online Multiplayer.  Uncomment the button named "Loading" on the Main Menu.  Room creation and joining are already enabled and work.  Currently syncing of token color and position across the network only happens the moment a player joins a game and online turn dynamics (whoseTurn) is not updated properly.
